     When traversing a graph using breadth-first search, each vertex is enqueued once. This has a time complexity of O(V) . During this traversal, you also visit all the the edges. The time it takes to visit all edges is O(E) . This means the overall time complexity for breadth-first search is O(V + E).
     The space complexity of BFS is O(V) since you have to store the vertices in three separate structures: queue, enqueued and visited.
