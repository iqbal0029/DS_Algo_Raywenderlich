/*
 If there are few edges in your graph, it is considered a sparse graph, and an adjacency list would be a good fit. An adjacency matrix would be a bad choice for a sparse graph, because lots of memory will be wasted since there aren't many edges.
If your graph has lots of edges, it's considered a dense graph, and an adjacency matrix
 would be a better fit as you'd be able to access your weights and edges far more quickly.
